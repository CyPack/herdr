# SESSION HANDOFF — Herdr Native FM — 2026-07-14

## 1. SONRAKI ADIM

Execute B1.0 highlighter/dependency research, then make
TP-B1.1-BOUNDED-READ RED before writing B1 production code. Follow the full B1
test-point contract in `.codex/TASKS.md` sequentially.

## 2. AKTİF PROJE

- Project: `/home/ayaz/projects/herdr`
- Branch: `feat/native-fm`
- Goal: native, Lua-free file manager on Herdr's composable TUI foundation.
- Acting GitHub identity: `CyPack` external contributor; fork-only writes.

## 4. CLAUDE OTURUMUNDA TAMAMLANANLAR

1. Onboarding, rust-dev lessons, codebase graph freshness audit, task restoration.
2. S2 named region extraction, commit `c043c1e`.
3. Isolated-development test documentation and Claude semantic hook.
4. S3 re-scope and A2.1 center-region directory render, commit `d026e94`.
5. `prefix+f` activation across the two-layer keybinding system, commit `74d3cc9`.
6. Keyboard navigation/input interception, commit `d2b27e6`.
7. Detailed native-FM next-session prompt generated.

## 5. BU CODEX OTURUMUNDA TAMAMLANANLAR

- Recovered and verified the Claude transcript directly from local storage.
- Implemented A2.2 responsive Miller columns with cached parent/preview state.
- Added RED tests first, then achieved full GREEN verification.
- Built this Codex CLI continuity, memory, skill, hook, launcher, and handoff package.
- Committed A2.2 as `6c7c58f`, reindexed it, and fast-forward pushed only the
  CyPack feature branch and fork master.
- Implemented A4 native file watching test-point-first: pure normalization,
  generation/lifecycle safety, bounded channel/coalescing, path-preserving
  refresh, real-filesystem convergence, explicit polling fallback, and a
  2-second reconciliation safety-net.
- Made two pre-existing wall-clock-sensitive tests deterministic after full
  nextest exposed them under parallel load.
- Committed A4 separately as `01ba91d` and the deterministic test-only fixes
  separately as `8cd4e89`, using targeted staging only.
- Completed B0 Image Path Beta test-point-first with generated exact RGBA,
  malformed decode, synthetic local placement, upload/display/dedup/view/
  replacement/removal lifecycle, cursor framing, and isolated real-host tests.
- Captured a visible local Path Beta pattern in throwaway Kitty and an
  independent Path Alpha Yazi preview baseline; closed only the test windows
  with targeted semantic input.
- Recorded a conditional GO for B2: reuse existing `kitty_graphics`, bound all
  decode/allocation work, keep I/O outside render, reject stale generations,
  and prove cleanup plus real-host output.
- Committed B0 separately as `bcba84d`, full-reindexed it, and fast-forward
  published only to CyPack feature/master.

## 6. KOD DURUMU

Committed product/test history through `bcba84d`:

- `c043c1e`: `src/ui/shell.rs`, `src/ui.rs`, `src/app/state.rs`, `src/app/mod.rs`.
- `d026e94`: `src/ui/file_manager.rs`, `src/ui.rs`, `src/app/state.rs`, `src/app/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`.
- `74d3cc9`: `src/app/actions.rs`, `src/app/input/navigate.rs`, `src/config/keybinds.rs`, `src/config/model.rs`, `src/ui/keybind_help.rs`.
- `d2b27e6`: `src/app/input/file_manager.rs`, `src/app/input/mod.rs`, `src/fm/mod.rs`, `src/main.rs`.
- `6c7c58f`: `src/fm/mod.rs`, `src/ui/file_manager.rs`.
- `01ba91d`: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`,
  `src/app/file_manager_watcher.rs`, `src/app/mod.rs`, `src/app/runtime.rs`,
  `src/fm/watcher.rs`, `src/fm/mod.rs`.
- `8cd4e89`: `src/server/headless.rs`, `src/terminal/state.rs`.
- `bcba84d`: `src/kitty_graphics.rs`.

`bcba84d` is fast-forward published to both CyPack `feat/native-fm` and fork
`master`; both remote refs were verified at the exact local SHA. The separate
continuity/task-state commit containing this handoff follows it. Product
staging is empty.

## 7. TEST KANITI

- B0 targeted Path Beta: 4/4; full `kitty_graphics`: 25/25.
- Final full nextest: 2916/2916 passed, one explicit interactive host probe
  skipped, no retry.
- Linux all-target and canonical Windows MSVC binary-target clippy passed with
  `-D warnings`.
- Bun 17/17; Python maintenance 64/64; fmt and diff-check clean.
- No new dependency. Doctests are N/A because Herdr has no library target.
- Real Path Beta and Path Alpha both rendered in separate throwaway Kitty
  windows. No stable Herdr process or socket was touched.

## 8. KRİTİK KARARLAR

- Pure render is non-negotiable.
- S3 registry deferred to S5; use concrete content swap until abstraction is earned.
- S2 persistence deferred to S6.
- A2.2 caches parent/preview in `FmState`.
- A4 uses stable `notify-debouncer-full 0.7.0` / `notify 8.2.0`.
- Native watching is primary; startup/runtime errors enter explicit polling
  fallback, and all active watchers reconcile every 2 seconds to cover silent
  FUSE/NFS/exFAT-class delivery failures.
- A4 and B0 are implementation-complete, verified, and published. B0's B2
  decision is conditional GO; B2 remains ordered after B1 and the A3 remainder.
- The user granted standing authorization for autonomous atomic commits and
  CyPack fork-only fast-forward pushes. Do not repeatedly ask for alignment;
  never relax targeted staging, verification, ancestry, or remote-SHA checks.

## 9. GÜVENLİK

- Never kill user processes.
- Never touch `/home/ayaz/.local/bin/herdr` or the stable socket.
- Clear inherited socket variables and use throwaway XDG directories for runtime tests.
- Never stage ignored `.local` files into product commits.
- Never push `upstream`.

## 10. AÇIK GÖREVLER

See `.codex/TASKS.md` for the full B1 test-point contract plus A3, B2,
C1–C6, S5–S7, N2, and M1–M3 roadmap. A4 and B0 are closed. B1 is active.

## 11. ORTAM

- `codex-cli 0.144.1` is installed.
- `just` is absent; direct recipe execution is required unless installed later.
- Full post-B0 graph reindex completed at 17,624 nodes / 83,295 edges and
  returned `frame_graphics_bytes`, the exact-RGBA Path Beta test, and
  `miller_layout`.
- `mcp-proxy.service` cold start measured 54 seconds for 26 servers. Readiness
  now has a 120-second internal and 150-second systemd budget; live proof was
  `expected=26 observed=26 critical_tools=14`.
- `~/.codex/skills/rust-dev` points to the canonical Claude `rust-dev` skill; parity reports no broken skill links.
- Global Codex hooks support SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit; Herdr context routing is scoped to this repo.

## 12. BAŞLATMA

Run:

```bash
herdr-codex
```

The new agent must read `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/BOOTSTRAP.md`, `.codex/CURRENT.md`, and `.codex/TASKS.md`, then verify graph and Git state before acting.
